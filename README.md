The challenge is to build out an early access landing page.

The tools used are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This challenge does include some JS, but it's only a small amount for the custom form validation.

The users would be able to:

  Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:

    The Email address field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
    The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"
    View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
    See hover states for interactive elements
